# Sonawap Paystack PHP library
Helps you manage and use Packstack's api

## To Start run

```bash
Composer require sonawap/paystack
```


## Define your paystack key

Go to vendor > sonawap > paystack > core > config > config.php then replace with your key

Create a new file index.php

Include the autoload file

```php
<?php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Using the Library


```php
use Sonawap\Paystack\Transaction\Transaction;
use Sonawap\Paystack\Customer\Customer;

Create a new instance of the class

```php
$transaction = new Transaction();
$customer = new Customer();
```

Now you have access to all the methods in the classes, see docs or example for details
